# Rolling-ball
This is my first ever 3D game which goes by the name Rolling Ball. To create the game, I used Unity version 2019.4.40f1 and custom #csharp scripts.

*About the game:*
It is a basic game with the simple objective of collecting objects and preventing the ball to go out of bounds.

Hereâ€™s a link to the game, thanks to the itch.io and unity team.(It currently supports web browsers only)
