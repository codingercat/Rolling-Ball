# Rolling-ball
This is my first ever 3D game which goes by the name Rolling Ball. To create the game, I used Unity version 2019.4.40f1 and custom C# scripts.

*About the game:*

ðŸš© It has the simple objective of collecting only specific objects and preventing the ball to go out of bounds.

ðŸš© I added death capsules and attached C# scripts to them in such a way that the boolean variable allowed the ball to direct the game to end and reload whenever the ball interacts with the object.

ðŸš© Learnt the various concepts of Object Oriented Programming such as polymorphism, abstraction(by using already existing functions such as GetActiveScene(), Rotate() for adding behavior in the objects, etc), and encapsulation.  

ðŸš© Understood the application of Tree Data structure through the Prefabs and the parent-child relationship and properties it shows.

ðŸš© Used in-built libraries of Unity such as UnityEngine Scene Management, System.Collections, System.Collections.Generic, Input System, etc.
